\section*{|| Technical skills ||}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Skilled in C and C++, mainly C or a sane C++ subset which does not cripple compile nor run times. Over 5 fully-dedicated years of personal programming experience in these languages. Fairly good understanding of assembly language (x86-64). Thorough experience integrating and using libraries, such as LLVM, GLFW, Dear ImGUI, STB single-header libraries, sokol, meshoptimizer, Volk, Raylib, Qt, Expat, JSMN...
	
	\item Comfortable in command-line environments and qualified in systems programming, both Windows (Batch, Win32) and Unix (Bash, POSIX).
	
	\item Fond of data-oriented programming. You have to know the platform and the data you are working with in order to obtain the solution of your problem. Passion for computer architecture and hardware understanding in order to get the most out of it. Object-oriented understanding. Professional experience in both of them.
	
	\item Compiler engineering experience developing several toy programming languages with mostly everything handwritten.
	
	\item Short personal experience with low-level graphics APIs, such as Vulkan, OpenGL and DirectX (11, 12), having practiced more with the open-source ones. Basic understanding of game engines and the GPU pipeline.
	
	\item Brief personal experience on kernel development. Booted some operating systems written from scratch with very primitive functionality.
	
	\item Expertise working with files, parsing and generating them, both text and binary formats.
	
	\item Language interoperability based on the C ABI. Binding creation to interoperate between C, C++, Objective-C, Rust and Zig.
	
	\item API design and project organization.
	
	\item Use of build systems like CMake, MSBuild, Makefile, Zig Build, Maven and Ant.
	
	\item Use of version control systems such as Git, Perforce or CVS, both professionally and personally.

	\item Experience with other programming languages, like Java, Rust and Python.
