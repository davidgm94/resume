\section*{|| About me ||}
\paragraph{}I am extremely passionate about systems programming, always eager to learn and self-taught at several areas of computer science in general. I love to invest all my spare time into having a better picture of how computers work and programming my many hobby projects. I care about performance, simplicity and quality.
