	\subsection*{\underline{Compiler: \href{https://github.com/Renaissance-Software/compiler}{https://github.com/Renaissance-Software/compiler}}}
	Last of several compilers which I wrote. Although I have used LLVM in the past, this one is fully handwritten, from the lexer to the code generation, with a LLVM-like intermediate representation. The back-end currently supports x86-64 primitively and can write MSVC and System V ABI code and PE32+ and ELF64 executables. Support for ARM64 and Mach-O is on the way.
	\subsection*{\underline{Metal bindings for Zig: \href{https://github.com/davidgm94/zig-metal}{https://github.com/davidgm94/zig-metal}}}
	On-going work to support Apple's Metal graphics API in Zig, interoperating with C and Objective-C for the purpose.
	\subsection*{\underline{Kernel from scratch: \href{https://github.com/davidgm94/osdev}{https://github.com/davidgm94/osdev}}}
	Custom kernel written from scratch for the x86-64 architecture. Basic CPU setup.
	\subsection*{\underline{Game engine: \href{https://github.com/davidgm94/glez}{https://github.com/davidgm94/glez}}}
	Very basic game engine with 3D model rendering and GUI debugging.
