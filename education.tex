\subsection*{\underline{Bachelor degree in Computer science at UOC}}
\underline{(2017 - 2019, 2022 - expected to end in June 2024)}\\\\
Online education which I try to gain as I work both professionally and on my loved personal projects.
\subsection*{\underline{Private mentorship with Andreas Fredriksson (August 2021 - November 2021)}}
The Principal Engineer at Unity volunteered to mentor me. We discussed professional career and explored low-level programming topics with a focus in speed, data and simplicity. He taught me how to properly face engineering problems that I considered interesting and complicated. In general he made me grow very much as a programmer.
