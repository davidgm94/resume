\subsection*{\underline{Bachelor degree in Computer science at UNED (2017 - 2021)}}
\subsection*{\underline{Private mentorship with Andreas Fredriksson (August 2020 - Present)}}
The Principal Engineer at Unity volunteered to mentor me. We discuss professional career and explore low-level programming topics with a focus in speed, data and simplicity. He teaches me how to properly face engineering problems that I consider interesting and complicated. In general he makes me grow as a programmer very much.
