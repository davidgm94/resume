\subsection*{\underline{Self-employed compiler developer (January 2021 - present)}}
Solo developer of a new compiler back-end for x86-64 and ARMv8 which aims to replace LLVM. The current target is to improve vastly build times for the back-end library and to provide fast iteration times for the users, to get as fast machine code as LLVM and try to improve upon it on new basis and to have a much better interoperability between the library and the user, improving the user experience in general. Everything until now is handwritten, with no use of libraries excepts the ones I write myself.

Real-time systems programming. Architectures to be supported were x86 and ARM. The software must run both in desktop and embedded software, meeting the RAM and CPU constraints of the lowest-end hardware. Developed file transfer through serial port communication using IEC 60870-5-103 and REST webservices for the software which the protection-monitoring devices in the electrical substations run.
